# learnlua.lua

Speed Learn Lua with a comprehensive guide.<br>
*This is more intuitive for a more experienced programmer*

Created by exoad

My journey with Lua

Targetted for 5.2+. *You are more than welcome to contribute with addendums for other versions of Lua that have different dialect on how
something should be used.*

**Read the barebones version here**<br>

## Reading

Coding style is presented with a simple example followed by a commented explanation.

The de facto code is stamped in `./snippet.lua`. This code is not usable and only for evaluation!

For example:<br>
```lua
print() --[[
  The print() function is primitive Input/Output function in Lua.

  By running it with print() no arguments, nothing is printed.

  By running it with arguments like print("Hello World") -> Hello World will be printed to the STDOUT
]]
```

Each section is marked with a commented feature like so:<br>
```lua
-------------------
--[[ SECTION A ]]--
-------------------
```

# TODOs

- [X] Make a web version -> Port all code to a website based.
- [ ] Make a beginner friendly learning style and still keep the more experience cheatsheet
- [ ] Make a generalized Lua Cheatsheet

> Always work in progress (for improvements) :)
