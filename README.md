## Reading

Coding style is presented with a simple example followed by a commented explanation.

The de facto code is stamped in `./snippet.lua`. This code is not usable and only for evaluation!

For example:<br>
```lua
print() --[[
  The print() function is primitive Input/Output function in Lua.

  By running it with print() no arguments, nothing is printed.

  By running it with arguments like print("Hello World") -> Hello World will be printed to the STDOUT
]]
```

Each section is marked with a commented feature like so:<br>
```lua
-------------------
--[[ SECTION A ]]--
-------------------
```

# TODOs

- [ ] Make a web version -> Port all code to a website based.
- [ ] Make a beginner friendly learning style and still keep the more experience cheatsheet
- [ ] Make a generalized Lua Cheatsheet

> Always work in progress (for improvements) :)
